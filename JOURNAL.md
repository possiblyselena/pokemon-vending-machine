# Total Time spent: 6 hours
# June 24th: Designing the Schematic and Code sorta
Since I'm not using a PCB for this, I used TinkerCAD to lay out all my parts and test some code out. I did not finish the code however since I can't import certain libaries, but I added some logic so I can understand myself better for next time. I actually do not own an arduino board, so I have to wait until I get my parts to program it fully. Also to note that I'm powering the LED stripe seperatly from my board, but in the schematic it's wired for visual purposes.

# June 25th: CAD and coding
I realized if I make a 2 x 2 pokemon dispenser, I wouldn't be able to 3D print a big enough case for it, so I'm going to make it 2 x 1 and it makes the selection shorter (How am I going to get that many booster packs anyways). I removed 2 servos from my diagram.

I started on the case of my vending machine! I have two wrappers of pokemon boosters, so I used that as reference while I figure out th dimensions.

I still need to finish the back and interior, along with the button covers, shelves, and other contraptions with the vending machine but that's for tomorrow's session.

# June 26th: Fixing CAD

Ok, I made my pieces too big still, so I changed the dimensions for all the parts. I have started assembly, so I mated the outer parts except for the back and design the inner parts as I go. I'm going to hit a quick grocery run and I'll be back later today to finish the rest.

I'm back and I designed pokeball shaped button caps for my push buttons! I'll be printing two of these.

Servo attachments so I can spin the coil. I will also need two of these.

The shelf the pokemon cards go on. There a hole in the bottom so I can move the LED strip through it.

Finished assembled case!

After looking at the code a bit more, I swapped out the distance sensor and refined my BOM! Now all I got to do is get my parts.

**Total Time: 5 hours**
