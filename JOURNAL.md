# June 24th: Designing the Schematic and Code sorta
Since I'm not using a PCB for this, I used TinkerCAD to lay out all my parts and test some code out. I did not finish the code however since I can't import certain libaries, but I added some logic so I can understand myself better for next time. I actually do not own an arduino board, so I have to wait until I get my parts to program it fully. Also to note that I'm powering the LED stripe seperatly from my board, but in the schematic it's wired for visual purposes.

# June 25th: CAD and coding
I realized if I make a 2 x 2 pokemon dispenser, I wouldn't be able to 3D print a big enough case for it, so I'm going to make it 2 x 1 and it makes the selection shorter (How am I going to get that many booster packs anyways). I removed 2 servos from my diagram.

I started on the case of my vending machine! I have two wrappers of pokemon boosters, so I used that as reference while I figure out th dimensions.

I still need to finish the back and interior, along with the button covers, shelves, and other contraptions with the vending machine but that's for tomorrow's session.
