# June 24th: Designing the Schematic and Code sorta
Since I'm not using a PCB for this, I used TinkerCAD to lay out all my parts and test some code out. I did not finish the code however since I can't import certain libaries, but I added some logic so I can understand myself better for next time. I actually do not own an arduino board, so I have to wait until I get my parts to program it fully. Also to note that I'm powering the LED stripe seperatly from my board, but in the schematic it's wired for visual purposes.
