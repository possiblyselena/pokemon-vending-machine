# Mini-Pokemon Vending Machine

Quite recently I've been raving about Pokemon cards and I found out that there's Pokemon Vending machines. Although Canada doesn't have them yet, why not make my own personal one? It's also a cooler way to store your sealed booster packs when you're saving them for later. 

The Pokemon Vending machine requires 1 TCG coin to use, then you're able to select from 1 of 2 different packs in the machine! Sounds lame but in this economy I can barely find a singular pack. Once selected, the pack will dispense on the left.
